// Our handlers move the card, which unmounts the element that was just being

//       const dropping = source?.status === 'dropping'   // source.status
//       if (dropping) { wait for source.status === 'idle', then reset() }
//     })
//
// so a source destroyed during the dispatch takes its Feedback effects with it
// and nothing is left to bring its status back to idle. dragOperation.reset()
// then never runs, the operation stays in 'dropped' forever, and every later
// press is dropped on the floor by handlePointerDown's `!status.idle` guard --
// silently, which is why a dead board still logs a pointerdown and nothing else.
// Whether the unmount lands before or after that microtask is up to when React
// commits, which is why it took a few drags to wedge.
//
// A task, not a microtask: the teardown above is itself a chain of promise
// callbacks, and the point is to come after all of them.

// mid-animation, it never goes idle, the reset never runs -- and the manager
// goes on believing a drag is in progress, ignoring every press after it. The

// that the Distance constraint would have started at 5px, and the press is lost
// with a beforedragstart followed by a canceled dragend and no dragstart at all.
// Whether a drag works then depends on how fast the hand moved. Distance alone
// for a mouse, which is also what react-beautiful-dnd asked for; touch keeps a
// hold, or dragging would fight scrolling; a real grip needs no threshold,

// These go on the manager's own monitor rather than on DragDropProvider, and
// that is not a style choice -- passing any of them as a prop stops drags from
// starting.
//
// The provider wraps onBeforeDragStart, onDragOver, onDragMove and onDragEnd in
// its renderer's trackRendering(), which parks a *pending* promise in
// renderer.rendering and only resolves it once a startTransition() commits.
// Meanwhile the manager, having just dispatched beforedragstart, does:
//
//     dragOperation.status.set('initializing')
//     this.manager.renderer.rendering.then(() => ...status.set('dragging'))
//
// So with a beforedragstart handler attached, becoming a drag waits on a
// low-priority React render of a board that re-renders on every store update.
// Until it commits the operation sits in 'initializing', and releasing the
// pointer runs `canceled = !status.initialized` -- a beforedragstart followed by
// a canceled dragend and no dragstart, which is exactly what the console showed.
// Worse, the promise is cleared only by that same commit, so a starved
// transition leaves a permanently pending promise behind and every later drag
// awaits it too: a few drags work, then none do, then one does again.

// trackRendering, so renderer.rendering stays Promise.resolve() and the
