// Package plugin is the protocol a source plugin speaks: JSON-RPC 2.0, one
// message per line, over stdio.
//
// The transport is the one ACP and MCP already use here, and for the same
// practical reason — everything around it is written: procgroup spawns a
// process group and cleans it up, the proxy registry expands into an
// environment, and a wire trace is a file. A port per plugin would need all of
// that again and buy nothing.
//
// The shape of the contract is a protocol rather than a Go interface because a
// plugin has to be writable in another language: an interface cannot be
// implemented from TypeScript. See docs/sources.md, §9.
