// routes name and a "Workflow" property whose options are their names, so the
// whole mechanism can be seen — and picked — before anything is configured.
//
// Nothing is imposed by seeding them. A card takes a route only when it names
// one (its "Workflow" option), so a board that ignores the property behaves
// exactly as it did before: the standalone trigger columns and nothing else.
// Several routes also mean the "single registered flow" fallback in resolveFlow
// stays out of the way.

// Columns come from the config wherever the config already names one, so
// renaming triggerColumn renames the stage with it; the two stages with no
// config key of their own are named here.
